Outrageous Villager Accents

Add-on for the Bedrock edition of Minecraft that gives villagers a really bad French accent

Build the pack with [Bazel](http://bazel.build)

In the project folder use the command:

```
bazel build :outrageous_accents
```

Of course, you can also just zip up the assets folder and rename it to have an mcpack extension. That's probably easier for most people.
